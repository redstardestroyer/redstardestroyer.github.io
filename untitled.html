<h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

<P>  Dear Eileen,        </P>
<P>
Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your
PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) next year. I will answer your
questions one by one, in the following sections.
</P>
<h2>Starting dates      </h2>
<P>
We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
First semester:
<time datetime="2016-09-09"></time> 9 September 2016
</li>
Second semester:
<timer datetimer="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</timer> 
</li>
<Li>Third semester:
<time datetimes="2017-01-15"> 2 May 2017</time>
</UL>
<P>
Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would
prefer.
</P>
<h2> Subjects of study        </h2>
<P>
At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research
facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science
and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the
ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of
priority:
</P>
<ol>
Turning H<sub>2 </sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>3<sub>0<sub> 3</sub>).
</li>
<li>
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures
exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
(effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 104).
</li>
<li>
<addr> HTML</addr>, Hypertext Markup Language, and CSS,
Cascading Style Sheets, constructs for representing musical scores.
</li>
</ol>
<P>
So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and
other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
</P>
<h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
<p>
Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I
<em> did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my
favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:
</p>
<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
<dd>
    A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as
    300 <abbr title="before common Era">BCE</abbr>,a whole village would
    dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to
    be "fruitful".
</dd>
<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
<dd>
    Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they
    used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a
    circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
    tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that
    he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
</dd>   
<dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
<dd>
    An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in
    the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by
    "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern
    Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were
    just moving like this because they were really cold.
</dd>
</dl>
<P>Yours sincerely,</P>
